- HTML5
- SCSS (Sass)
- Google Fonts for typography customization.
- Flexbox & Grid: Used for layout and element positioning.

## <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

-	**Responsive Design:** Uses SCSS mixins to adjust layout and padding for different screen sizes:
		Mixes for phones, tablets, and desktops dynamically change styles based on screen width, ensuring that content is optimized for tablets and desktops.
- **Flexbox & Grid:** Designed a flexible layout structure using a combination of Flexbox for alignment and Grid for custom page arrangements. SCSS variables and mixins enhance consistency and simplify layout adjustments.
- **Custom Hover Effects:** Added smooth transitions using a hover mixin to improve interactivity. Buttons, links, and other interactive elements feature subtle animations for an enhanced user experience.
-	**JavaScript Interactivity:** Implemented dynamic functionality, such as selecting radio buttons programmatically when users interact with specific UI elements. 
-	**BEM Naming Convention:** Maintained clean and scalable CSS by adhering to the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, ensuring consistency and reusability across the project.
